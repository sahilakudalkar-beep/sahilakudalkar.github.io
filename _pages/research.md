  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> Media campaigns can spur conservation action but may alienate local communities. Transforming such action into self-sustaining community-based conservation involves effective governance that rapidly integrates knowledge of resource dynamics, establishes flexible institutions, and fosters multilevel networks. This study examines the emergence of community-based conservation in response to a media campaign to protect migratory Amur falcons, illustrating shifts in governance and power dynamics that enabled local community ownership. Although conservation developed in the absence of an adequate preparation phase, external engagement, incentives, and recognition of local institutions' legitimacy were instrumental in fostering collective action. This research showcases how community-based conservation initiatives can be triggered by external social pressure but also how the long-term sustainability relies on effective governance that respects local institutions and employs cooperative strategies to build trust and foster ownership among local communities. </p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> Exclusion of people from wilderness to minimize anthropogenic threats to wildlife forms the historical basis for the establishment of some protected areas. Conservation efforts to resettle people from protected areas remain controversial as they often fail to address people's expectations and rebuild lives, especially in Africa and South Asia. Resettlement projects are especially challenging for the Indian government, with an estimated 4.3 million people sharing spaces with megafauna such as tigers and elephants within protected areas. Current Indian government policies focus on cash-based or a combined cash-land compensation package for families voluntarily relocating. We surveyed 592 households from four Indian protected areas and evaluated people's decisions to move relative to government policy provisions. Many (89%) households wanted to move for better education, healthcare, roads, agriculture, less human-wildlife conflict, and the government-aid package. Wage-labor dependent households chose to move due to high human-wildlife conflict, poorer small landholders for better agricultural opportunities, and larger households to avail government package benefits. Current government policies place heavy emphasis on agriculture-based livelihoods, poorly support other developmental needs or provide for alternative livelihoods. We call for greater transparency and participation of beneficiaries in the process, policy expansion to diversify skills and vocational training, accompanied by independent long-term monitoring post-resettlement. </p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> Preventing loss of crops, threats to livestock, damage to property, and human injury and death attributed to wildlife are conservation challenges. We surveyed over 5,000 households around 11 reserves in India to examine these issues and mitigation efforts. Crops were lost by 71% of households, livestock by 17%, and human injury and death were reported by 3% of households (losses attributed to 32 species). Households deployed 12 mitigation measures with nighttime watching, scare devices, and fencing used the most. A household’s conflict history (>20 years for livestock loss, 10–20 years for crop loss), proximity to reserves, and crops grown or livestock owned were associated with higher mitigation use. There were differences across reserves, with households in Rajasthan least likely to use mitigation. Crop protection (88%) was more likely than livestock protection (32%). Investments in conflict mitigation should consider the history, location, species, socioeconomic variations among households, and differences in regional policies. </p>
