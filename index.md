Hello! I am a third-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs.

My primary research interests are in innovation, political economy and environment.

I hold Masters degrees in Public Policy (The University of Chicago), and Conservation Biology (State University of New York). Prior to joining Columbia, I spent seven years of research and project management experience on topics such as wildlife trafficking, human-wildlife conflict, endangered species, resettlement of forest-dwellers from protected areas, and community-based conservation. In my free time, I enjoy bird-watching, hiking and running.
